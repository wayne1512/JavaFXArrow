# JavaFXArrow
A quick customizable Arrow Shape Node for you JavaFX project. This can be used like any other shape provided with JavaFx like https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/shape/Circle.html and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/shape/Rectangle.html

"arrow dimesions.png" is a colored diagram which labels the different dimensions of the arrow.
"arrow dimesions.docx" gives the name of the dimensions as used in code.

Feel free to use it, fork it, change it and do whatever you want with it.

Not tested to work in any sort of production enviroment, just needed it for a quick test and decided to upload this here since I couldn't find anything like it.

Probably won't be fixing any issues with it. Feel free to send a pull request for the off-chance that I consider it.

Hope you find this useful :)
